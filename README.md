# Set up OctoPi on NEM Printers

OctoPi is a full OS intended for running OctoPrint, and is based on Raspbian.  It's a perfect choice for running OctoPrint on Raspberry Pi systems.

## Bill of Materials

You need the following for each printer:

1. Raspberry Pi 3B or newer [Example](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-3-model-b-plus-kits)
2. Power supply providing 5V and >= 2.5A [Example](https://www.canakit.com/official-raspberry-pi-power-supply.html)
3. MicroSD card of at least 32GB size [Example](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=micro+sd+card+128GB)
4. 3D printed case for Raspberry Pi to attach to its printer's frame [Prusa Example](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2334119) / [Ender Example](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4586351)
5. A USB-A to USB-B cable [Example](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=usb-a+to+usb-b)
